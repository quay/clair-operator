                      Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example: Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route.

                    description: |-
                      SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource.

                      In the following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                      - Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values. - Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match both specified values.

                      Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources. If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is interpreted.

                      When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource. For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
